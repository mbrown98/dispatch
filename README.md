# dispatch.

dispatch. is a real-time messaging platform. Users can create/join any room, and have conversations with anyone else in that room. The backend runs on the awesome technology of Node.js and socket.io

My hope is to eventually develop this application into a sports themed platform. Where users could selected their favorite team (or eventually players) and have great conversations with others
